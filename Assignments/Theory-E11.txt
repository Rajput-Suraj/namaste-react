1.  What is prop drilling?
    - Prop drilling is the process of passing down data or state through multiple layers of a component hierarchy. By the way, it 
      refers to the practice of passing data from a parent component to its children and then from the children to their own children 
      and so on, until the data reaches the desired component that needs it.

2.  What is lifting the state up?
    - Sometimes, you want the state of two components to always change together. To do it, remove state from both of them, move it to 
      their closest common parent, and then pass it down to them via props. This is known as lifting state up, and it’s one of the most 
      common things you will do writing React code.

3.  What is Context Provider and Context Consumer?
    - Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

      - Context Provider is used to provide access to a context between multiple components of the application. We can provide the access 
        to the context or the data layer to the whole application to the and its subcomponents.

      - Context Consumer is used to consume the context data , provided by react context. We can do this using useContext hook for 
        functional components and Context.Consumer in clasees based components.

4.  If you don’t pass a value to the provider does it take the default value?
    - If we do not override the values of context it takes the default values form the context , when we initialise the context.
