1.  What is Microservice?
    - A microservices architecture, also simply known as microservices, is an architectural method that relies on a series of independently deployable services. 
      These services have their own business logic and database with a specific goal. Updating, testing, deployment, and scaling occur within each service. 

2.  What is Monolith architecture?
    - A monolithic architecture is a traditional model of a software program, which is built as a unified unit that is self-contained and independent from other applications.

3.  What is the difference between Monolith and Microservice?
    - With monolithic architectures, all processes are tightly coupled and run as a single service. This means that if one process of the application experiences a spike in demand, the entire architecture must be scaled.
    - With a microservices architecture, an application is built as independent components that run each application process as a service. These services communicate via a well-defined interface using lightweight APIs.

4.  Why do we need a useEffect hook?
    - The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components. Data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in React components are all examples of side effects.

5.  What is optional chaining?
    - The optional chaining (?.) operator accesses an object's property or calls a function. If the object accessed or function called is undefined or null, it returns undefined instead of throwing an error.

6.  What is shimmer UI?
    - A shimmer UI resembles the page's actual UI, so users will understand how quickly the web or mobile app will load even before the content has shown up.
      It gives people an idea of what's about to come and what's happening (it's currently loading) when a page full of content/data takes more than 3 - 5 seconds to load.

7.  What is the difference between JS expression and JS statement.
    - An expression is a bit of JavaScript code that produces a value.
    - A JavaScript program is a sequence of statements. Each statement is an instruction for the computer to do something.

8.  What is conditional rendering, explain with a code example.
    - Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators 
      like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

    - Weâ€™ll create a Greeting component that displays either of these components depending on whether a user is logged in:
      
      function Greeting(props) {
        const isLoggedIn = props.isLoggedIn;
        if (isLoggedIn) {
          return <UserGreeting />;
        }
        return <GuestGreeting />;
      }

      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); 
      // Try changing to isLoggedIn={true}:
      root.render(<Greeting isLoggedIn={false} />);

9.  What is CORS?
    - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.
      CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a "preflight" request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, 
      the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.

10. What is async and await?
    - The async function declaration declares an async function where the await keyword is permitted within the function body. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.

11. What is the use of `const json = await data.json();` in getRestauarants()
    - The json() method of the Response interface takes a Response stream and reads it to completion. It returns a promise which resolves with the result of parsing the body text as JSON.
